# 🔐 File Encryption & Decryption using AES-256

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **secure file encryption and decryption** using the **AES-256 algorithm** implemented in Python.  
It allows you to protect sensitive files by converting them into encrypted data and later decrypting them back to their original form using the same key.
